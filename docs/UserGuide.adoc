== Introduction

[[OofWelcome]]

=== What is *OOF*?
*OOF* (Oustanding Organisational Friend) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) program that allows you  to save your tasks, assignments, modules taken, etc. *OOF* is catered towards university students who want to use a desktop application to manage their tasks in a friendly and efficient manner. *OOF* is optimized for users who prefer to work with the CLI while still reaping the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

=== What can *OOF* do?
Besides saving your tasks very effectively in persistent storage, *OOF* allows your tasks to be displayed in friendly formats such as calendar format or a tabular format where your tasks are sorted chronologically for any particular week. You can also let *OOF* remind you of tasks that are expiring based on a customisable threshold. On top of that, you can track your progress and see if you are on track by using our tracking feature.

=== How does *OOF* address our target audience?
Most university students are often busy and *OOF* aims to reduce the time students spend on managing their tasks. *OOF* allows students to enter one-liner commands quickly into our program and hence spend less time logging down the tasks to be done. Furthermore, *OOF* allows tasks to be viewed in insightful formats and also provides timely reminders for tasks with their deadline nearing.
