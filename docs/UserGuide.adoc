== Introduction

[[OofWelcome]]
.OOF welcome screen
image::OofWelcome.png[OofWelcome]

=== What is *OOF*?
*OOF* (Oustanding Organisational Friend) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) program that allows you  to save your tasks, assignments, modules taken, etc. *OOF* is catered towards university students who want to use a desktop application to manage their tasks in a friendly and efficient manner. *OOF* is optimized for users who prefer to work with the CLI while still reaping the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

=== What can *OOF* do?
Besides saving your tasks very effectively in persistent storage, *OOF* allows your tasks to be displayed in friendly formats such as calendar format or a tabular format where your tasks are sorted chronologically for any particular week. You can also let *OOF* remind you of tasks that are expiring based on a customisable threshold. On top of that, you can track your progress and see if you are on track by using our tracking feature.

=== How does *OOF* address our target audience?
Most university students are often busy and *OOF* aims to reduce the time students spend on managing their tasks. *OOF* allows students to enter one-liner commands quickly into our program and hence spend less time logging down the tasks to be done. Furthermore, *OOF* allows tasks to be viewed in insightful formats and also provides timely reminders for tasks with their deadline nearing.

=== What is this guide for?
This guide aims to educate you on how to use our application by providing example usages of all its features. The features can be found in <<Features>> section.
