* The Outstanding Organization Friend (OOF) is catered towards university students who want to use a desktop application to manage their tasks to be done. 

* OOF is optimized for users who prefer to work with the Command Line Interface (CLI) while still reaping the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* OOF allows users to:
** store tasks in the application
** track time spent on tasks
** plan your semesters
** display tasks in a calendar
** display free time slots
** view upcoming tasks in weekly table format
** provide reminders for users for approaching deadlines
